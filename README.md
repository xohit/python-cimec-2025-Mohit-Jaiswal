# python-cimec-2025-Mohit-Jaiswal
Hosts a mini-project as part of final submission for the Python coursework of summer 2025, for CiMeC PhD year 1 (Cycle 40).

The notebook is documented well enough to dictate what is going on, but I will provide a gist here as well.

The project aims at designing behavioral transition matrices for mice behavioral data, which includes parameters like grooming, sniffing, atttack, freezing, etc. This is part of my previous work as an intern at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Rome, where I worked on the territorial induction in the mammalian hypothalamus. Before delving in the neural basis of such territorial aggression in the ventromedial hypothalamus, behavioral basis of the said aggression needed to be studied and analyzed. Such analysis included understanding the behavioral dynamics through video data, followed by utlizing SimBA (Simple Behavioral Analysis) and DeepLabCut (DLC) pipelines.

So, in the contents of the notebook, you will see I proceeded (with synthetic/ghost data), and how I tried to design network plots, thus informing us about further analysis downstream.

I worked on Google Colab, so it is very straightforward. You just have to connect to the local runtime and just execute every cell sequentially. I have included all the libraries I have used, so there should not be any errors or inconsistencies.

Thanks!
